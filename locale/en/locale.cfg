scenario-name=Oarc's Multiplayer Spawning Scenario

description=This scenario allows every player to create their own spawn point when they join the game. There are a lot of helpful features to ensure that new players can join at anytime in the game or even join other players. This is a multiplayer only scenario.\n[color=red][font=default-bold]You must first create a config.lua file if one does not yet exist![/font][/color]\nIn the scenario folder, copy "example-config.lua" and name it "config.lua". Edit the file with any text editor. This is the only way to configure your scenario options and it MUST be done before starting a new game.\n[color=yellow][font=default-bold]Always start a new game when changing the config or updating the scenario![/font][/color]\nPlease visit https://github.com/Oarcinae/FactorioScenarioMultiplayerSpawn for the scenario source code, Wiki, and if you want to file any bugs. The wiki has instructions on how to best start games on dedicated/headless servers!\n[color=yellow][font=default-bold]If you got this scenario from the mod portal or by joining a server, make sure you remove any blueprint.zip files in the scenario folder![/font][/color]
